<p>===Unathi Black Egg Plague At Record High! (powered by Nanotrasen®™)===</p>

<p>The Hegemony High Council has released a statement today confirming what has been circulating amongst the circles of the unathi population: Black Egg Syndrome has been at an all time high, at thirteen percent and rising.
<p>For readers who are unaware, this is a condition that mainly targets unathi females, sympthoms include unathi egg clutches including one or several eggs which are covered in a dark, hard, leather like substance, which makes hatching for the young skinks next to impossible thanks to how solid the egg is compared to normal. Often times this will result in the egg being left for dead in the wild, and the female is reclassified as male due to their cultural value decreasing.</p>

<p>Beyond confirming what was suspected, Hegemony, as well as Solgov officals, have declined to comment. Skrellian officals, meanwhile, have remarked that they would seek a cure for this deliberating condition, as a token of goodwill after the war years earlier involving the Hegemony, Skrell, and Solgov.</p>

<p>Obituary - Pablo Jenner</p>

<p>Pablo Jenner passed away while fighting giant space bears during a mining expedition on the evening of October 10th, 2563, at the age of 76. He will be greatly missed for his service. He has lived a rich life of mining on various planets and moons, and continued on even after losing his legs to other creatures, he was a real trooper.</p>

<p>His last words were to a certain Margaret and it said: "Tell her she's a bitch."</p>

<p>Respects can be paid at the Yawn Wider Colony, where his remains are currently kept.</p>

<p>===Tragic Tram Crash on Virgo 3B!  (powered by Nanotrasen®™) ===</p>

<p>Tragic news from Virgo 3B today. The orange line tram's automated brakes failed to engage when arriving at one of the waystations on the route. The resulting crash ended up destroying the small station's tram terminal, as well as the tram car itself. The automated systems however, did not pick up on the crash until much later, reporting that the train was still moving as normal. It wasn't until crewmembers aboard the next stop on the line, Yawn Wider Station, noticed that the tram was mysteriously missing, that technicians realized what had happened.</p>

<p>The tram contained two passengers, Sabel Hall, 34, Human; and Farket Mrrhalka, 21, Tajara. Only Sabel's body has been located at this time, though the explosion, coupled with the harsh environment, leads investigators to presume that Farket was also killed.</p>

<p>A memorial service will be conducted for the victims of the tragic accident on their home colony. In the meantime, technicians begun repairs on the orange line, and, in the meantime, workers should use short range teleporters, or a different tram line, to make it to and from their workplace</p>

<p>Spooky celebrations: The capital city on Sol IIIᵃ  is due to begin the 2563 celebration of its annual "Festival of Spirits", a 45 day long celebration of various cultures' supernatural-centric holidays. The festival kicks off with Earth's american region holiday "Halloween" on day one, followed by its neighbor to the south's "Día de Muertos" (Day of the dead) on day two. For a full list, see exonet address sol.luna.spiritfest.nt. New entries into the line-up this year include an performance enactments of Hawaii, Earth's "Nightmarchers", and Doradus IV's temperate zone holiday "Eve of the Seafolk"</p>

<p>Mystery probe: An uncrewed probe of mysterious make and origin has been detected at the fringes of Nanotrasen space. Reportedly, it does nto match the construction materials or techniques of any galactic power, and governments and corporations alike are denying involvement in the machine's manufacture and operation. Just as soon as it was detected, the probe enabled a series of stealth systems one-by-one including heat sinks, subspace radio jamming, EM field scattering, and what is theorized to be an advanced form of spacetime distortional phasing until it finally escaped detection.</p>

<p>Box Office Record Scared to Death: The new Horror holofilm "Alone in the void", in which a multi-species crew on a station outside of reliable communications range must fight to survive a power failure, while attempting to decipher the mystery of who, or what, is killing personnel one by one, opened to an astounding 517 billion thalers, after the success of a long, extensive exonet viral marketing ARG spanning an area of 39 systems. Contestants had to find public exonet terminals with notes adhered to them, dig up buried cases of clues, and in one instance, actually space walk on an asteroid covertly registered by the studio under the name of a non-existent small mining company.</p>
